# nycflightdelays_R
Utilizing nycflights dataset, this repository explores the factoring determining flight delays for UA flights in 2013. The language used for analysis is R. 

This project will use the data included in the nycflights13 package. 

 

Suppose you work for United Airlines (carrier code UA). To improve both efficiency and customer satisfaction, you've been asked to study departure delays. 

 

Prepare a report that utilizes the exploratory data analysis methods that we have been studying, and permutation tests, to analyze departure delays. 

 

Your report should address the relationship between departure delays and each of the following:

Time of day
Time of year
Temperature
Wind speed
Precipitation
Visibility
 

For each of these factors, you can decide whether to use the original dep_delay variable, or the late and very_late variables you created for the first two homework assignments (for some questions, you may only be able to conduct a permutation test (based on what we've learned so far) if you use the late and very_late variables). If there are circumstances where you feel it is appropriate to create new variables based on the other factors being analyzed, you may do so, but be sure to clearly indicate that you have done that. 

 

You should prepare a written report that includes appropriate graphs and tables, written for a non-technical audience (something you could give to someone in management to illustrate your results without getting into details about coding and such), along with an appendix that includes the code you used, clearly labeled to explain what part of the main report each section of code corresponds to.
